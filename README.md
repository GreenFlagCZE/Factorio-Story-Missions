Hi!

If you have any kind of problem with instalation, unzip and
copy the folder "campaigns" to your folder with game. Normally is like this:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Factorio\data\base\campaigns

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The story missions pack supports many languages, you're free to translate it to your own language. 
Simply open "...\campaigns\story-missions\local" or any local in levels. 
Copy .cfg file from EN folder to your file with national inicials, open the .cfg file with txt editor and you are free to go. :)

When you are done, contact me and I'll add the file to installation folder in next update.
