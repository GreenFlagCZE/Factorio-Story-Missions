msg-base-1=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] This is EGSS Astrid, EarthGov dreadnought space ship. We're here to engage the pirate ships in orbit. \n\nWe' ve sent a shuttle with a prototype autonomous walker called [font=default-bold]SPIDERTRON[/font] to secure the perimeter around our bases on the planet. We want you to take the controls and test the machine. \n\nHold on a second, we're picking up an incoming transmission from the shuttle... \n
msg-base-2=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Pirates just located and shot down a space shuttle that crashed northeast of your position. According to the readings, the crew did not make it, but the walker made it without major damage.\n\nMove as quickly as possible to the crash site and secure the prototype.\n
msg-base-3=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Use the walker to get to the nearest base. When it is possible, we will make an orbital bombardment against the bug hatcheries.\n\nThe goal of your mission will be to use the prototype walker to secure all the bases in the area that are under attack by the bug swarms.\n
msg-base-4=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Engineer, is that you? Eh, we could use a little help here. We're kind of surrounded by bugs, and I'm expecting them to have us for dinner in a few hours. \n\nOur power generators are working, but the bugs have eaten all the batteries, which is having a very negative effect on our laser turrets. Why don't you bring that corporate marvel back to our base and put it to the test? You can even help us repair the [font=default-bold]ACCUMULATORS[/font].\n
msg-base-4.1=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] Use the [font=default-bold][color=blue]Discharge defence[/color][/font] equipped in the Spidertron with [font=default-bold][color=blue]remote[/color][/font] to deal heavy damage or stun all nearby enemies. It consumes energy from your batteries when it's activated.\n
msg-base-5=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] The accumulators are charging, great! \n\nIt's enough for a while, but the bug swarms are growing bigger and bigger. Unless a miracle happens, it's hard to keep this area under our control. Because of the fighting on orbit, the dreadnought can only help us with limited capacity. \n\nThere are other bases in the east that need the same help as we do. \n
msg-base-6=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] First of all, we need to complete some important researches and gather as many resources as we can. The problem is that the sandstorms are worsening the conditions for our lab work, so researches are [font=default-bold]2x MORE EXPENSIVE[/font].\n
msg-base-7=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Engineer, we need to extract as much of the local resources as possible and when the heat's on, we will leave the area. Help us research and manufacture equipment for the other bases. \n\nReplenish your weapons and ammunition for the walker! When you're ready, I'll send a signal to the dreadnought and they will help us clear the way from the bugs.
msg-base-7.1=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] You can set Spidertron to [font=default-bold]AUTOMATIC TARGETING WITHOUT GUNNER[/font], the walker will blast approaching bugs without you having to pilot the vehicle.\n
msg-base-8=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] I don't think there's much more we can do here. It's time to move on. Astrid's gonna be bombing our way to Triumph Station. \n
msg-base-9=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Coordinates received, stand by. \n\nLieutenant, lock weapons on position Charlie, Omega — Tango, Omega — Delta, Echo, Lima, Alpha, Sierra.\n\nCode Red. Nuclear attack in progress. Keep your distance.\n
msg-base-10=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Bombardment complete. Now it's up to you.\n
msg-base-11=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Thanks Astrid, we're on our way. \n\nEngineer, get into the walker and clear the path of any remaining bugs as we move to Triumph Station.\n
msg-base-12=[color=orange]TRIUMPH STATION:[/color] What the hell... MY EYES! Moment! Crystal Peak? Is that you? \n\nI don't know what happened, but suddenly my radio started working. Did you fry the bugs? \n\nMy equipment on the station is pretty crappy. I was originally going to start a production of the uranium munitions, but my [font=default-bold]CENTRIFUGE[/font] isn't working as it should.\n
msg-base-12.1=[color=orange]TRIUMPH STATION:[/color] Unfortunately my best technician was eaten by biters yesterday, what a shame I tell you... \n\nIf you have someone who understands this technology, could he put this together a little bit?\n 
msg-base-13=[color=orange]TRIUMPH STATION:[/color] Aha! Ou, you're saying the centrifuge wasn't plugged into the grid? Eh, he, he, he... Oh. \n\nNah. You're a genius, Engineer! Thank you!\n
msg-base-14=[color=orange]TRIUMPH STATION:[/color] Yeah... Welcome to my humble residence. My workers are at your service. You know your trade, don't you? My refineries have virtually no juice. There are pumpjacks north of the station, but... you know... They just aren't working.\n
msg-base-15=[color=orange]TRIUMPH STATION:[/color] Ahhh! One more thing. \n\nDo you remember when I mentioned the uranium ammunition? The assembly machine for production is at your full disposal. You just have to protect it from the biters. I don't know why, but the smell of uranium attracts them. Which has its advantages and disadvantages... Don't use it for anything else, I'd get very angry!\n
msg-base-16=[color=orange]DUNE BASE:[/color] ...(interference)... chrrzpsh \n...(interference)... we'll try them ...(interference)... \nreactor ...(signal loss)...\n
msg-base-17=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Engineer. We have to move. Dune Base in the east just went silent. Last communication said something about fuel cells for the reactor... They must have serious problems. \n\nI'm sending you a list of items you need, once you have them ready, I'll send a signal to Astrid.\n
msg-base-18=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Receiving, stand by. \n\nLieutenant, the coordinates are Bravo, Uniform, Golf, Sierra. \n\nNuclear attack in progress. Keep clear.\n
msg-base-19=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT LIEUTENANT:[/color] Captain. Chambers 1 through 3 are jammed! The rockets are stuck.\n
msg-base-20=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Damn it. You wait down there, we'll try to... \n
msg-base-21=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Going somewhere?!\n
msg-base-22=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT LIEUTENANT:[/color] Captain! Enemy ships in sector 4! \nRadiological alert. They' fired nukes at us!\n
msg-base-23=[color=orange]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] Evasive manoeuvres!\n...(loss of signal)...\n
msg-base-24=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Let's hope Astrid's okay. But let's focus on our mission. \n\nWe need to get to the Dune base in the east and get their reactor back online.\n\nHopefully Astrid has cleared the way enough for us and ...\n
msg-base-25=[color=orange]DUNE BASE:[/color] ... Ah, finally. We have a signal. \n\nWe need [font=default-bold]URANIUM FUEL CELLS[/font] for the [font=default-bold]REACTOR[/font]! Our centrifuges are offline. \n\nWe're just barely surviving thanks to the backup generators near the iron mines, but they're too badly exposed. If the bugs attacks, we won't be able to defend them.\n
msg-base-25.1=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Fuel is on the way Dune. Hold on a little longer!\n
msg-base-26=[color=orange]DUNE BASE:[/color] The reactor is online. The power supply should stabilize any moment now!\n
msg-base-27=[color=orange]DUNE BASE:[/color] I'll be honest. The base infrastructure is really bad. We have no combat experience at all, and our defenses against the insects are poor. \n\nIf we could have more of those [font=default-bold]SPIDERTRONS[/font], we might finally have a chance!\n
msg-base-28=[color=orange]DUNE BASE:[/color] There are very rich deposits of raw materials in the area, but they are too close to the bug nests. We have plans to build an [font=default-bold]ARTILERY[/font], take them, Engineer. \n\nArtillery is great, but it also attracts bug invasions very easily, use them wisely.\n
msg-base-29=[color=orange]DUNE BASE:[/color] With more Spidertrons, we'll squash the insects once and for all!\n
msg-base-30=[color=orange]TRIUMPH STATION:[/color] Good job, guys! Send me 3 of those walkers right away!\n
msg-base-31=[color=orange]CRYSTAL PEAK:[/color] Looks like you saved the day again, Engineer. I still have no information about Astrid, only that there are some serious fireworks happening in orbit.\n\nI'll keep you posted if I find out more.\n


think-msg1=Damn, no gasoline. I need to find some fuel.
think-msg2=There are so many of these bugs' nests! 
think-msg3=I should watch my pollution levels and proceed with caution.
think-msg4=Otherwise, I'm f*** 
think-msg5=I mean, otherwise I have no chance of defending the base.
