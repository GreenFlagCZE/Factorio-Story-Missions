msg-base-angry=[color=orange]NUCLEAR POWER PLANT:[/color] What the hell are you doing! We're under attack! Biters're everywhere! The reactor is down, we're defenseless!  
msg-base-1=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Glad you are here. \n\nOur defense system on the river's been acting crazy recently. It's probably a faulty power line. Can you fix it? \n\nHmm. Wait a minute! I'm picking up some strange signals. Give me a minute.
msg-base-1.1=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Something strange is going on. I'll try to chrzzz... (interference).
msg-base-2=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Greetings to the government corpo-rats of this beautiful planet. Did you think you could keep all the wealth for yourselves and not share it with us? Our space pirate guild will quickly disabuse you of that delusion.
msg-base-3=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Our defenses on the river have just been compromised. What the hell is going on?!
msg-base-4=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Beautiful, so many interesting things falling from your drones. It would be a shame to leave these valuable products floating in the river... Ha ha!
msg-base-5=[color=orange]NUCLEAR POWER PLANT:[/color] Hello? Can anyone hear us? Where are the transport drones? \n\nOur power plant is running low on uranium fuel cells! The emergency shutdown of the reactor will occur in approximately [font=default-bold]5 HOURS[/font]. \n\nWithout a working reactor, we'll be vulnerable to a bugs attack. We need to restore the fuel supply!
msg-base-6=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Time is running out... \n\nOur facility will try to send new drones to the power plant, but if the hacked towers aren't disabled in time, we are doomed.
msg-base-7=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] We've sent a [font=default-bold]SPECIAL DRONE[/font] to your base. When it reaches the end of its life, the nuclear reactor will run out of fuel. \n\nWe don't want to put pressure on you, but you have to keep up with the time.
msg-base-8=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Satellite has detected that a pirate faction has set up a blockade on the bridge over the river. [font=default-bold]DESTROY THE BLOCKADE[/font] to gain access to the other side.
msg-base-8.1=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Ah, one more thing. We also lost contact with our supply outpost [font=default-bold]NORTHWEST[/font] from your base. I know you don't have much time, but you can find valuable resources there.
msg-base-9=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER[/color] Ouch, so much brute force... I love it when things blow up! Too bad you're doing it all for nothing. Ha Ha Ha!
msg-base-10=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] The bridge is again under our control! We now have access to the other side of the river. \n\nHowever, the entrances to the islands are well protected. Unfortunately, we have no choice but to [font=default-bold]DESTROY THE LASER TOWERS[/font] blocking access to the river islands.
msg-base-11=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER[/color] Boom, bang! Ha Ha! I really like you! Too bad you have so little time... Hmm, tick, tock!
msg-base-12=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] This is taking too long. Maybe there's another way. \n\nThe lasers are powered by electricity. But the nuclear reactor has closed the circuit due to low fuel levels, so the laser towers are now powered by another source. The most powerful source is the backup [font=default-bold]STEAM TURBINES[/font] located along the river. The destruction of the turbines should be enough to disable the defensive system along the river. \n\nPlease hurry, there's not much time left.
msg-base-12.1=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] Use [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__shoot-enemy__ [/color][/font] to target enemies. \nTo attack neutral targets like trees or non-combat buildings, use the [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__shoot-selected__ [/color][/font] key.\n
msg-base-13=[color=orange]PRODUCTION FACILITY:[/color] Well done! The laser system is losing power and the drones have a safe passage again.
msg-base-14=[color=orange]NUCLEAR POWER PLANT:[/color] We have restored power again. \n\nThank you.
msg-base-15=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Do you think you've outmatched us? HAH! This isn't over yet. \n\nWhen we meet again, you'll be the one running. Ha ha!
think-msg1=That doesn't look good.
think-msg2=Pirates hacked the defense system along the river and are shooting down drones!
think-msg3=Damn, some drones are also transporting nuclear fuel cells and munitions!
