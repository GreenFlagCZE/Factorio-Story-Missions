msg-base-hint1=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] For remote building you need to create a [font=default-bold]GHOST STRUCTURE[/font].\n\nSelect an item you want to build, hold down the [color=blue][font=default-bold]shift[/font][/color] key and place it by [color=blue][font=default-bold]left-mouse button[/font][/color] in an area out of your reach. In your case, the opposite side of the river.
msg-base-hint2=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] Click on the [font=default-bold]DECONSTRUCTION PLANNER ICON[/font] in the [color=blue][font=default-bold]shortcut bar[/font][/color] and select any red [color=red][font=default-bold]PASSIVE PROVIDER CHEST[/font][/color] to deconstruct. \nRemember, if the ghost structure is not created, the deconstructed items will be transported to the nearest yellow [color=yellow][font=default-bold]LOGISTIC STORAGE CHEST[/font][/color]
msg-base-hint3=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] You can [color=blue]set the amount[/color] of items transported to the blue [color=cyan][font=default-bold]REQUESTER CHEST[/font][/color]. \n\nHowever, be careful [font=default-bold]NOT TO OVERWHELM THE LOGISTICS NETWORK[/font] with large demands. Be sure you have enough logistics robots for transport. The same goes for construction robots.
msg-base-1.1=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] The bugs! They're coming son! \n\nPrepare yourself!\n
msg-base-1=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Hey, engineer. Welcome back. \n\nWhile the government corpos are fighting for one half of the planet, I'm starting to have a real bug problem here! I hear the space vermin are somehow able to control them. Anyway, it's really messing up my business. \n
msg-base-2=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] My mining drills are mostly on the other side of the river. In fact, it's more like a swamp and it's not very easy to build there, so my obedient [font=default-bold]LOGISTIC ROBOTS[/font] help me out with everything here. But I have very few of them and the bugs are attacking more and more often. I'm afraid my entire operation here will be for nothing. \n
msg-base-3=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] I need to ship out a certain amount of materials, but first we need to increase the number of transport robots! Help me finish researching the [font=default-bold]LOGISTICS SYSTEM[/font] and gather enough resources before this place becomes overrun with bugs! \n\nI had more robots, but I sent them on a scouting mission and they got lost.\n
msg-base-4=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Oh yes, you probably noticed the destroyed [font=default-bold]REACTOR[/font] on the coast. Don't ask how it happened. But if you fix it, you'll have so much power that... that... Um. What did I say?\n
msg-base-5=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Where are the days when I was driving my space-trailer in the eighties, with asteroids and planetoids rolling in my rear. Those were hard times, full of hard work! But now all I need now are these little robots and all they need is a bit of power and they can carry a heck of a lot of debris! Maybe if you [font=default-bold]UPGRADE[/font] them in the labs, they'll carry even more and be faster!\n
msg-base-6=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] My cute little robot Timmy found a pirate [font=default-bold]RADAR[/font] up north. I'll bet my neck they're sending telepathic-radio-bla-bla... commands to the bitey bugs, and they're busting my ass! If you destroy it, it'll solve all our problems! \n\nBut if you're not capable of dealing with it, I won't hold it against you. We're not soldiers after all. The corpos have a job for us, but first I need to develop [font=default-bold]LOW DENSITY STRUCTURES[/font].\n
msg-base-7=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] I see you're doing well in your research. Keep it up, kid. Keep it up! \n\nJust watch out for those bitey things. There's more and more of them, and they're getting bigger...\n
msg-base-8=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Yay! You're done. Great! Keep the robots producing enough so they can transport the raw materials to us faster! \n\nOh, and by the way, those corpos will pay me well if we supply them with some [font=default-bold]STEEL, FUEL, ELECTRIC MOTORS AND A FEW LOW DENSITY STRUCTURES[/font]. It's not exactly a small request, but they pay very nicely! Well, a war with pirates comes at a price!\n
msg-base-9=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] You did it! You're the smartest engineer in the entire system. I knew you wouldn't let me down! The money's just pouring in!\n\n

msg-base-bot-1=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Engineer! My lost bots. The worms are going after them! Save them, quickly! \n
msg-base-bot-2=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Those worms didn't stand a chance. You fried them pretty good. \n\nI once sent more of my robots on a scouting mission, I expect they' ll return eventually. \n\nI'll keep you posted when that happens.\n
msg-base-bot-3=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] My robots and those worms again! I told them to hide, but they're running out of juice. Please save them! \n
msg-base-bot-4=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Fly my robots, you are free! \n
msg-base-bot-5=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] No, NO! No! \n\nMy robots! \nWorms eat them for breakfast!\n
msg-base-bot-6=[color=orange]OLD SPACE MINER:[/color] Ah, thank you, engineer. \n\nThe bots are coming back to help us again with our job! \n

think-msg1=I have to decide whether it's worth focusing on destroying the radar or continuing the research.
think-msg2=There will be no room for a change of tactics later. I'll either concentrate on attacking or mining now.
think-msg3=I should relocate passive provider chests on other side of the river.
think-msg4=If I bring them to the coast as close as possible, the robots won't have to fly as far.
think-msg5=Hmm, I should build more labs.
