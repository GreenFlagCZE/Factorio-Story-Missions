description=You survived the harsh conditions of the unknown planet where you crash-landed years ago. Now you're back on a mission to help a government corporation establish a new mining colony. However, you know well what dangers the planet holds. \n\nThe story campaign contains a total of 10 full missions. Each mission has a series of mandatory and optional tasks. There is no respawn in the campaign, don't forget to save the game regularly.\n\nDo you like the story campaign? Would you like more missions or even play them cooperatively with a friend? Creating missions is not an easy thing, so I'll be glad if you support this project here.\n\n https://www.patreon.com/greenflag \n https://www.buymeacoffee.com/greenflag \n https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=FGMDUNG56SEA8 \n\n Thank you and enjoy the game! :-)\n\n-GreenFlag-
