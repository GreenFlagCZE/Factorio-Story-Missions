msg-base-1=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] We've managed to track down the pirate outposts in this wasteland. We believe they are storing stolen material from previous attacks on our production facilities. \n\nIt' s still unclear what exactly the pirate faction is planning. Attacks on this scale are unusual, there must be more behind it. \n\nOn top of that, the insect colonies here are extensive. We're in the process of installing artillery, but that will take some time.
msg-base-2=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] Somewhere in the desert are pirate assembly machines where they process stolen uranium. Infiltrate the outposts and destroy them. \n\nWe're sending you satellite scans now. During the infiltration, we can recommend you focus on sabotaging the power grid to disable their laser defenses. There's a good chance there'll be mines planted at the main gates. Be careful.
msg-base-3=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] We're giving you access to a small part of our base. Unfortunately, in this region, most of the resources are under bug control. You'll have to scavenge whatever you can find. \n\nOne last thing. You're not allowed to build anything outside the base until we secure the area. I'm sorry, but you're still just a freelancer. 
msg-base-4=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] It may sound like I'm just the bearer of bad news, but I've got something here to make you happy. We've prepared plans for you to develop power armor, shields, and laser weapons equipment. If you can acquire enough science packs, the labs are fully available to you. \n\nOh, I almost forgot. Southwest of here is a crashed old shuttle. I'm sure there's something worthwhile on board. \n\nGood luck.
msg-base-5=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] Use [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__shoot-enemy__ [/color][/font] to target enemies. \nTo attack neutral targets like trees or non-combat buildings, use the [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__shoot-selected__ [/color][/font] key.\n
msg-base-6=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Ah, welcome. Long time no see. \n\nYou may have succeeded in destroying this assembly machine, but next time you won't have it so easy. I' m kinda hoping you get blown to pieces by a booby mine. \n\nAre you excited? I'm thrilled. Just don't die now, my popcorn's still popping.
msg-base-7=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] One of the main assembly machines has been decommissioned, two more remain. Don't forget to steal back the stolen supplies from the pirate storage crates. 
msg-base-8=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Ehh, you're getting to be a real pain in the ass. Everyone thinks we're a bunch of barbarians hijacking spaceships and stealing from colonists on outer planets. But you have no idea what a mess you've gotten yourself into.  \n\nWell, there's a higher purpose and your corpo-government friends know what they're up against... They're hiding it from you, they're afraid, and that's why they're sending you against us as a useful but expendable pawn. \n\nYou will die. Sooner or later... how about in 10 minutes, when I've finished those crispy Space Nachos.
msg-base-9=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] Second assembly machine scrapped, last one left. \n\nSatellite has detected increased bug hatch activity. Expect more frequent confrontations with enemy biters. Don't forget to resupply the military base or we won't be able to produce advanced weapons and ammunition. 
msg-base-10=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] Last assembly machine destroyed. Well done!
msg-base-11=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] You have accomplished nothing. I warned you. It's too late now. \n\nDo you see it?! We have achieved what the corpo-rats tried to... what my comrades died for, and now everyone on this planet will feel it, and then the entire quadrant. Ha Ha Ha! \n\nYou played our game well...
msg-base-12=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] What?! What's going on? Why haven't we registered this? Secret base? Engineer, I don't know what's going on here, but we have to stop this immediately. Looks like the pirates can control the bugs! \n\nI don't understand why the satellite didn't detect their base before. They must have been using some kind of high-tech jammer. \n\nThose centrifuges process uranium and are suspiciously well defended. It's quite possible it's related to the bugs they have in their pens. Our artillery cannon is still not ready, but we have no time to waste! You have my full approval to destroy this devices.
msg-base-13=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] South of our base we have a secret lab. They should have a heavy weapons manufacturing facility. Bring some parts with you, I'm sending you a list. \n\nIf you need any ammunition, there are a warehouses to the north. However, due to the insect infestation, we had to leave the area. They're probably being looted by pirates now. Take care and good luck.
msg-base-14=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Ouh. You shouldn't have doing that. Now there's nothing to stop the bugs from flattening your tiny base. Ah, your BIG cannon will piss them off even more. \n\nWe're packing up, and so should you. Sajonara.
msg-base-15=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] The artillery is ready, we're loading it now. In two minutes, we're gonna wipe those bugs once and for all. Then we'll get to the bottom of these... (interference)
msg-base-16=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] Lieutenant, target the nearest hatcheries. I'm giving you permission to attack.
msg-base-17=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] There are too many of them, we can't hold on. I have no choice. \n\nI'm giving the order to evacuate the base. \n\nEngineer, help my forces to defend the base until the evacuation of civilians is done. We need five minutes.
msg-base-18=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] All personnel have been evacuated. \n\nEngineer! We've got a train waiting! Hurry up and take some fuel with you!
msg-base-19=[color=orange]MILITARY BASE:[/color] We lost our base today, but thanks to you, we left no one behind. You have done well. \n\nI'll go back to HQ and do a report. What happened here was just the beginning. The pirates couldn't have done all this alone. Someone else is behind this. I'll get to the bottom of this. \n\nI'll see you later.
think-msg1=According to the satellite, the main gate is well fortified, I should try to find some other way.
think-msg2=No wait! (interference)
think-msg3=Damn! I must get back quickly. 
think-msg4=I saw a tank parked here, hopefully it will still be functional.
think-msg5=Ah hell, it's already started. I hope I have enough ammo.
think-msg6=Come on, you slow piece of s-scrap!
