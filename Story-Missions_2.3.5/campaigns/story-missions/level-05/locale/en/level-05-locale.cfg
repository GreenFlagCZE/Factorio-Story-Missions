msg-base-1=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] The attack did not go as planned. Enemy forces managed to shoot down our bombers. Five artillery guns were not destroyed. Fortunately, we're jamming enemy transmissions and they still haven't figured it out that you've succeeded in capturing our old base. \n\nNow it's up to you to neutralize their [font=default-bold]ARTILERIES[/font] before they can target your position.
msg-base-2=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] You have to defend the existing base at all costs. If it falls again or is destroyed, the entire operation will be considered as a failure. Therefore, we are giving the order to secure the base first and [font=default-bold]RESEARCH ADVANCED WEAPON TECHNOLOGIES[/font]. \n\nOur intelligence has discovered that the artilleries are being supplied by trains. If you succeed in disrupting the train lines, you'll limit the combat capability of the enemy artilleries.
msg-base-3=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] There should be a decommissioned refinery south of your position. Getting this refinery operational is crucial to your further progress.
msg-base-3.1=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."Hey, boss, another of our posts just went silent. I keep getting beeps here too."...
msg-base-3.2=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."You idiot! Why didn't you notice before! Stop eating those potato chips, someone's bugging our junk and making a mess. Sh*t, put it here and press this."...
msg-base-3.3=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."WHAAAT! Corpo-rats have taken over one of our bases! Come on! Fire those cannons! What's taking so long, you lazy bastards!"...
msg-base-4=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] Great job with the first artillery, but the pirate faction has already figured out the position of your base and is preparing to strike. However, we have found a weakness in their targeting system. If you can sabotage their labs, the enemy will no longer be able to bomb your base. 
msg-base-4.1=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."Boss, another cannon. He, he's gone! Please don't hit me for this, I really can't help it."...
msg-base-4.2=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."GRAAAAA! You're a piece of ****"...
msg-base-5=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] We confirm that only 3 artillery guns remain. Keep it up and this area will be under our control again. \n\nWatch out for increasing bug activity. 
msg-base-5.1=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."No, no, no, no, NO! This failure must not be known to the leader. Oh, what am I going to do?"...
msg-base-5.2=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."Ehhh boss, I think I've got one more little problem. Maybe we accidentally have the unencrypted broadcasts whole time. Probably someone's listening us."...
msg-base-5.3=[color=red]HOSTILE BROADCAST:[/color] ..."Hmmmm. Really?"...\n\n...(screaming)...\n\n...(interference)...
msg-base-6=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] According to intelligence, the pirate faction should not be able to continue to target your main base. However, the last 2 artillery guns remaining are a risk to the surrounding areas. I recomend to use atomic bombs. \n\nOne more thing. The bugs are spreading faster around, as expected. Be careful how you proceed and don't underestimate the situation. 
msg-base-7=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] Pirate bases are paralyzed. There should be nothing stopping you from destroying the last of the artillery. 
msg-base-8=[color=orange]HEADQUARTERS:[/color] We lost a lot of good men today, but you made our mission successful. \n\nThis planet is ours, and none of the pirate filth will be allowed to expand here! And they certainly won't dictate their claim to this planet!
msg-base-9=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] I'm glad you enjoyed the game and made it to this point. \n\nThere were no story missions in Factorio so far, so I tried to make the game a bit more fun. Bringing the environment of a mysterious planet full of biters and spitters to life wasn't easy, and it took me several months of hard work. I believe this story is not the end and I would like to continue expanding it in the future. If you want to support this project, feel free to visit the forums or my Patrion. \n\nThank you very much for finishing this campaign. \nSincerely, \nGreenFlag[/color]
msg-base-10=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] I'm back! HA HA HA! \n\n Did you think this was the end? Ohohooou, NO! \n\nThe greatest hell is yet to come for you...
msg-base-11=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] This planet will eat you thanks to my beetle friends which I already fully control! And when I'm done with you, I'll conquer the entire quadrant, leaving Earth as the last icing on the cake. Ha, ha! 
msg-base-12=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] WoW, if you made it without cheat. You are really good. \n\nOk, I'll give you a reward. \n(if that qualifies as a reward). \nI'll talk a little bit about the progress of the missions. Overall the first mission is very much based on the core of the fourth tutorial, which has a lot of similar scripts. If you decide to dig into the code, please don't blame me for it being a bit dirty (happy smile). [/color]\n\n
msg-base-13=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] Second mission: \nConceptually this mission is quite simple (go there, build this). I'm not so interested in this way of playing, but I was limited by my knowledge of Factorio code. Most of my time was taken up by the actual construction of the Space Center facility, which isn't actually used much in the game. Spoiler: I expect to revisit the mission in the future. Oh, and the buildings themselves are actually blueprints from YouTuber Nilaus. Although we don't know each other personally, but thank you for your helpful advises on YT.\n\n[/color]
msg-base-14=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] Third mission: \nYou guessed it and I won't lie to you. That's right, I got a lot of inspiration from the Factorio screen menu (ha ha). I struggled the most with how to do the timings in the game. It took me 2 days and I haven't figured it out at all. So in the end I added an immortal defensive drone to the game, which when it's life expires, the game ends. \n\n[/color]
msg-base-15=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] Fourth mission: \nThis mission is a category in itself. It has probably the most complex scripts I've ever come up with (or copied). I must have tested this mission a thousand times before I managed to balance it somehow.  \n\n[/color]
msg-base-16=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] Fifth mission: \nThat feeling when you start on a train and cinematic screen starts playing, as you're breaking through enemy defences, with gunfire everywhere and something exploding all the time. How epic! As far as development went, the train itself was the biggest problem for me, and I'm still not happy with it. Technically, you're thrown into the plot and you don't really know why things are exploding and why you're attacking a pirate base. The intro doesn't actually kick in until you get off the train and conquer the base. Unfortunately, due to my limited knowledge of LUA Factorio, I couldn't think of a better way to do it. I'll do better next time. [/color]
msg-base-17=[color=green]GREEN FLAG:[/color][color=cyan] Well, that's it. It was a hell of a ride.\n\nFarewell and see you next time.[/color]
think-msg1=Oh, crap, the debris of government bombers are falling all over the place. So much for the moment of surprise...
think-msg2=I should quickly destroy the gun turrets and retake this base.
think-msg3=I need to assemble some vehicle as soon as possible and head out to scout the area.
think-msg4=Ahh, finally. It's been tough, but all the artilleries are down. I'd like a beer now.
think-msg5=Advanced technologies done, with good equipment it should be easier to neutralize artilleries.

intro=Government forces are bombing pirate artilleries while you are launching an assault to capture a former military base Lost Point. Enemy defenses are compromised, laser turrets are down and you are using an armored train as a battering ram. \n\n[font=default-bold]Mission Objectives:[/font]\n- Secure the Lost Point base\n- Destroy enemy artilleries\n\n[font=default-bold]Mission Intel:[/font]\n- When you arrive at the base, react quickly to the situation. Enemies will immediately attempt to destroy all laser defenses. Explore the surrounding debris or train wagons to find the appropriate tools to save the laser turrets.\n\n- Don't build in northern areas. You risk being targeted by enemy artilleries.\n\n- Focus on guerrilla attacks on enemy infrastructure such as railways or laboratories. This will cripple the effectiveness of enemy artilleries.
