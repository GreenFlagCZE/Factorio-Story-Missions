intro=NEXT MISSIONS COMING SOON \n\nI'm glad you enjoyed the game and made it to this point. Next missions coming very very soon!\n\nThere were no story missions in Factorio so far, so I tried to make the game a bit more fun. Bringing the environment of a mysterious planet full of biters and spitters to life wasn't easy, and it took me several months of hard work. I believe this story is not the end and I would like to continue expanding it in the future. If you want to support this project, feel free to visit the Mod Portal or Discord Server. \n\nThank you very much for playing the campaign. \nSincerely, \nGreenFlag
