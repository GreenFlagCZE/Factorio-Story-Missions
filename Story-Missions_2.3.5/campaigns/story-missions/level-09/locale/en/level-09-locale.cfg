msg-base-fail=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] You can't be serious! I gave you a simple task, and instead you're lounging around. Get out of my sight!\n
msg-base-1=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Engineer, don't just stand there... \n\nChop that tree on the copper deposit, and build more [font=default-bold]ELECTRIC MINING DRILLS[/font]. We desperately need to increase our production!\n
msg-base-2=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] I apologize for the rude greeting, but every minute is precious. \n\nI'm the commander of Area 2020. I've heard nothing but praise for you, Engineer.\n
msg-base-3=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Most bases and outposts in the area are destroyed or controlled by pirates. They also send us daily bug greetings. Our [font=default-bold]ROCKET SILO[/font] is actually threatening them. \n\nThe EGSS Astrid is currently eliminating pirate ships in orbit, but they desperately need ammunition. Apparently everyone has underestimated the pirates' combat capabilities, which also makes me very concerned.\n
msg-base-4=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] The [font=default-bold]HELL'S GATE[/font] Space Port can't provide any resources, so we're the only ones left. If we fail, we are done. \n\nEngineer, please help us [font=default-bold]DEFEND THE SILO[/font] while we prepare a rocket with ammunition for Astrid.\n
msg-base-5=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Sorry for the interruption.\n\nCommander, the bugs have established a [font=default-bold]NESTS[/font] around the base and they are now attacking the [font=default-bold]SOUTH GATE[/font]!\n
msg-base-6=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] \nLet them come. I have a surprise for them. \n
msg-base-7=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Engineer, get rid of the nests near the base. I'm sure you'll be able to handle it without a problem.\n
msg-base-8=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] I'm giving you access to the base. You can improve our production. Be warned, some technologies are not researched yet. So don't just scrap all assembling machines that currently might be useful to you.\n
msg-base-8.1=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Commander, we have a problem. One of the spitters broke into our weapons storage, and melted down our artillery ammunition. Also, all the equipment and plans for artillery production have been destroyed.\n
msg-base-8.2=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] War never changes, right? Engineer, we still have one [font=default-bold]ARTILLERY TURRET[/font] on the base and a [font=default-bold]ARTILLERY WAGON[/font]. If you make ammo, you can do whatever you want with them. However, use the artillery wisely. After all --- they can attract unwanted attention of the enemies.\n\nAlso, don't count on being able to construct more artillery cannons anytime soon.\n
msg-base-8.3=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Well done, Engineer.\n\nGet to the safety before I send you further instructions.\n
msg-base-9=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] \nWell, it's done. Now we can...\n
msg-base-10=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] \nCommander! The pirates are planting mines near the track! They're probably trying to blow up the railway bridge!\n
msg-base-11=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] \nVisualize the position!\n
msg-base-12=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Hmm, track's a mess. Looks like the pirates made a new home on the island. Engineer, maybe if you blow up those [font=default-bold]STEAM ENGINES[/font], you'll knock out their defenses. \n\nWe need this railway. There are numerous iron and oil resources in the south.\n
msg-base-13=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] According to satellite, there is another path leading to the island through the swamp. It's a good chance they don't have that strong a defenses there. \n\nEngineer, follow the old railway tracks near the southwestern shore. You can't miss it.\n
msg-base-14=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Pirate laser towers are down! Well done. \n\nEngineer, there's a pretty large [font=default-bold]STONE FIELD[/font] on the island. It might be useful to build some mining drills here.\n\n Be careful though, there may still be pirate mines.\n
msg-base-15=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Sir, there's been an explosion in our labs. Someone detonated a bomb inside.  \n
msg-base-15.1=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Apparently, it was a diversion. The [font=default-bold]ROCKET CONTROL UNITS[/font] disappeared from the silo. They're all gone.\n
msg-base-16=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Are you saying there's a traitor among us? We can't get a rocket ready without those control units... \n
msg-base-17=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Do you remember our conversation a few weeks ago? I preemptively encrypted the tracking devices into all our systems. At that time, you suspected someone was leaking information to pirate faction.\n
msg-base-18=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Excellent work. What would I do without you. \n\nEngineer, we'll give you the coordinates to the stolen units. Your job is to get all the units back and install them in the rocket silo. \n
msg-base-19=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] The first unit is located [font=default-bold]SOUTHWEST[/font] of your position. Looks like the pirates have taken over the destroyed mining base. I'm sending coordinates.\n
msg-base-20=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Well done, Engineer. The additional units are at the abandoned outpost. I mean, if it can still be called abandoned...  It's under pirate control. But what concerns me more are the huge hatcheries nearby. \n\nIf you attack the outpost, it'll probably attract biters to your position. I'll mark the position on your map.\n
msg-base-21=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Engineer, I'm getting more signals from the units. They' re at the damaged chemical plant. The pirates took it over a few weeks ago.\n
msg-base-21.1=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] There are several routes leading to the area. I recommend systematically disabling parts of the plant. Focus on damaging the railway line to cut off the oil supply. There's a chance the pirates will run out of fuel for their electric turbines. \n\nAt the same time, the chemical plant has weaker defenses on the north, but the place is crawling with bugs. \n\nI'm sending you the coordinates to your map.\n
msg-base-22=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Hello, engineer. We meet again after a long time. \n\nI'm sorry, but I don't have much time for you right now. I'm sending my best regards to you. HAHAHA!\n
msg-base-23=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Engineer, look out! The pirates have targeted your position, and they're about to bombing the area! \n\nTake cover!!!\n
msg-base-24=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Are you still alive? Oh, come on, when are you gonna die? \n\nNever mind, I'll see you later... Mr. Engineer!\n
msg-base-25=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Ugh, that pirate scoundrel is annoying.\n\nAnyway, I managed to get the coordinates to the last unit. It's [font=default-bold]NORTHEAST[/font] of our base. But there's one very big problem. The pirate base is protected by [font=default-bold]SPIDERTRON[/font]. Apparently they captured it in the [font=default-bold]DEATH PASS[/font].\n
msg-base-26=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] \nDo you see that?\n
msg-base-27=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Yes. Strange... \n\nEngineer, if you have a moment, check out [font=default-bold]SOUTHEASTERN CAPE FROM OUR BASE[/font]. It's almost like something's... flying there. \n\nI marked the spot on the map.\n
msg-base-28=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Well done, engineer! \n\nGo back to the base as quickly as you can, and put the units into the silo. The rocket is waiting! We're just loading ammunition. \n
msg-base-29=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Sir, we should run a diagnostic on the units...\n
msg-base-30=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] No time. Astrid needs our help now! We must send a rocket into space as soon as possible. \n\nEngineer, when you insert the [font=default-bold]ROCKET CONTROL UNITS INTO THE SILO[/font], begin the launch sequence immediately.\n 
msg-base-31=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] The countdown is in progress. Two minutes remaining to ignite the rocket... \n\nWait, the systems are transmitting an unknown signal. \n
msg-base-32=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Alert! \n\nTactical nuclear missiles detected and approaching!\n
msg-base-33=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] Stop the launch sequence! \n\nActivate countermeasures! Ground-to-air cannons!\n
msg-base-34=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] The systems are not responding! The control units are encrypting data and compromising our defenses. It's some kind of virus! \n\nOne minute remaining to launch the rocket...\n
msg-base-35=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] What have I done... \nI should listen to you. \n\nOh, to hell with it. I'm going to manually remove the control units!\n
msg-base-36=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Sir, there's no time for that! \n\nIf you succeed, it' s no guarantee...\n
msg-base-37=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] EVERYONE, EVACUATE FROM THE SILO IMMEDIATELY! I'll try to get those units out! \n\nEngineer, that goes for you too. [font=default-bold]GET OUT, NOW![/font]
msg-base-38=[color=orange]BASE COMMANDER:[/color] \nOne more here... and... that's it. Haha! \nIt is done! The control units are disconnected! \n\nReach for... ...(interference)...\n
msg-base-39=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] \nNooo! No, no, no. NO! \n
msg-base-40=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Such a disaster...\n\nCommander, can you hear me?\n
msg-base-41=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] What are we gonna do? The base is destroyed. The commander... is dead.\n\nThis is the end.\n
msg-base-42=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] You're right, Engineer. We can't give up. We have to keep going. Commander would want that.\n\nI've found the plans for the silo. They're intact. We should focus on research and then construct a new silo.\n
msg-base-43=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Engineer, when you gather all the resources, build [font=default-bold]ROCKET SILO[/font] and begin constructing the rocket.\n\nI'll take care of the ammunition for Astrid, but I have one more request for you. I need you to construct a scientific [font=default-bold]SATELITE[/font] and put it into the rocket. We could use the collected data from it to improve our current weapons arsenal or make production more efficient. Will you do it?\n
msg-base-44=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Oh, no. The pirate faction has set up a silo in a former refinery [font=default-bold]SOUTHEAST[/font] from us. \n\nWe have to stop them from launching rockets!\n
msg-base-45=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Their defenses would be a tough nut to crack. They've got a strong fortification and several Spidertrons. A direct assault is almost suicide.\n
msg-base-46=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Maybe there is a chance.\n\n[font=default-bold]SOUTH OF THEIR BASE[/font] is [font=default-bold]FUEL STORAGE[/font]. Apparently they have [font=default-bold]ARTILERY MUNITION[/font] and a couple of [font=default-bold]ARTILERY WAGONS[/font] stored there. \n\nIf we can capture them, we'll be able to bombard the base from a safe distance.\n
msg-base-46.1=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] Yay! The pirate silo is destroyed! \nEngineer, I knew you could handle it! \n\nReturn to base if you can. We must continue to resupply Astrid.\n
msg-base-47=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] Do you think you can f*ck with me? Ha! I'm tired of your games! I will personally take care of your little dreadnought once and for all!\n
msg-base-48=[color=#FFBF01]EXECUTIVE OFFICER:[/color] How? How is that possible?! Engineer, target the position of those silos. We must destroy them immediately...
msg-base-49=[color=green]DREADNOUGHT LIEUTENANT:[/color] \nCaptain, several targets on a collision course and approaching.
msg-base-50=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] \nAnd I got you! \nNow you won't escape me anymore!
msg-base-51=[color=green]DREADNOUGHT LIEUTENANT:[/color] \nCaptain! They're still coming! They're gonna hit us!
msg-base-52=[color=#90EE90]DREADNOUGHT CAPTAIN:[/color] \nFire with everything we've got!
msg-base-53=[color=red]PIRATE FACTION LEADER:[/color] \nThis is good day to die! HAHAHAHA HAAA!\nRAMMING SPEED!\n\n...(huge explosion)...
