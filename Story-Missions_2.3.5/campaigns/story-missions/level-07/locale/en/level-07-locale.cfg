msg-base-1=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] I'm glad you're here.\n\nThe pirate faction uses our [font=default-bold]CROSSROAD RAILWAY SYSTEM[/font] to loot bases. But it's time for the tables to turn, and we regained control of the rail system. \n
msg-base-2=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] First we need to recover the stolen material so we can start securing our lost outposts and mines along the tracks. \n\nThere's an enemy base not far from your position and they're about to send a [font=default-bold]TRAIN[/font] full of contraband. You must stop their locomotive. When you succeed, we'll "hijack" the train with the contraband to our base [font=default-bold]RIVERSIDE[/font] and prepare for the next advance. \n
msg-base-3=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] We [font=default-bold]BARRICADED[/font] the track to help you slow down that armored colossus. The only way to stop the train is to [font=default-bold]DESTROY THE LOCOMOTIVE[/font]. \n\nBe careful not to damage the wagons in your attack. We need to get this cargo to the base in one piece!  \n
msg-base-3.1=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] You may ask why we don't simply blow up the tracks and stop the train. The problem is, if we disrupt the infrastructure of the tracks, we won't be able to help other bases quickly. Thus, you're [font=default-bold]FORBIDDEN TO DAMAGE AND DISRUPT THE RAILWAY SYSTEM[/font]. My superiors insist on it.  \n
msg-base-4=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] Use [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__shoot-enemy__ [/color][/font] to target enemies. \nTo attack neutral targets like locomotives, use the [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__shoot-selected__ [/color][/font] key.\n
msg-base-4.1=[color=yellow]TIPS AND TRICKS:[/color] To connect the locomotive, move close as possible to the wagons and press [font=default-bold][color=blue] __CONTROL__connect-train__ [/color][/font] key button.\n
msg-base-5=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] \nThe train is coming! \n\nGet in the car and prepare yourself!\n
msg-base-6=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Well done! This is gonna be a hard lesson for that pirate scum! \n\nYour next job will be to restore the electrical connection to the [font=default-bold]SOUTHPASS[/font] iron mine. As the name suggests, it's [font=default-bold]SOUTH[/font] of here. \n
msg-base-7=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] But you have to be sure that you can defend the restored mine from the biters.\n\nCorpos believe that if we can't defend the mines again, there is no point to invest in them anymore. So, in short, they [font=default-bold]DENIED[/font] any [font=default-bold]CONSTRUCTION[/font] of new [font=default-bold]MINING DRILLS AND PUMPJACKS[/font].\n
msg-base-8=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] What is worse, due to the halted rail transportation, the margin on parts has increased. So expect everything you build here will be [font=default-bold]MORE EXPENSIVE[/font] in terms of material consumption. \n
msg-base-9=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] The corporation gave you permission to modify the railway, but only at the Riverside base.\n\nI'll be also coordinate your progress here at the base. \nWe can do this together, I'm sure of it. \nGood luck. \n
msg-base-10=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Good work. Southpass will now provide us with iron ore. The mine isn't big, but we can compensate the mining efficiency with [font=default-bold]MODULES[/font]. \n
msg-base-11=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Corporates have given us the plans to research [font=default-bold]EFFECT TRANSMISSION[/font]. A so-called [font=default-bold]BEACON[/font] constructed near mining or production buildings can increase their efficiency or, conversely, reduce energy consumption. I recommend to concentrate on researching this technology. \n
msg-base-12=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Now that we have a secure supply of iron, we need coal. The [font=default-bold]DESERT MINE[/font] is [font=default-bold]NORTH[/font] from Riverside. Connect it to our grid. \n\nIf my information is correct, they have a locomotive idled there.\n
msg-base-13=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Once the coal mine is up and running, continue [font=default-bold]NORTHEAST[/font] to the [font=default-bold]CRATER COPPER MINE[/font] and bring it up and running. \n\nKeep an eye out for nearby bug activity.\n
msg-base-wait=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Watch out, the biters are attacking! Take cover!\n
msg-base-14=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Engineer, are you still alive? Good. \n\nLooks like the pirates wanted revenge and sent their pets after you. Lucky you have a lot of experience with the local flora and fauna. \n
msg-base-15=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] It's time to take out the next train. \n\nThe pirates haven't learned their lesson and sent another locomotive. It's now running between their two bases. Actually, this is the same track where we hijacked the first train.\n
msg-base-16=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Engineer, this time you will [font=default-bold]PLAN THE AMBUSH[/font]. I trust, you will be more creative than me. He, he.\n
msg-base-17=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] If you get bored while planning a train hijack, you can try to restore power in the stone mine [font=default-bold]GREEN FOREST[/font].
msg-base-18=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Damn, we got a problem. \n\nThe wagons are locked with a time lock. We can try to detonate it by force, but there's a risk of damaging the cargo.\n
msg-base-19=[color=brown]SMUGGLER:[/color] Greetings, gentlemens. \n\nI've been watching you for a while and I hear you're having some train trouble. I'm offering you a helping hand.\n
msg-base-20=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Who are you? This is an encrypted channel, how did you manage to...\n
msg-base-21=[color=brown]SMUGGLER:[/color] I possess many qualities as expected of a simple smuggler. And I may know a way to unload your cargo safely from the locked wagons.\n
msg-base-22=[color=brown]SMUGGLER:[/color] But I have a few conditions. If you build a track to my humble abode and provide some good quality fuel for my generator, I will be happy to unlock the wagons for you.\n
msg-base-23=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Looks like we don't have much choice. \n\nEngineer, take over this shady business. I think building the tracks shouldn't be a problem for you.\n
msg-base-24=[color=brown]SMUGGLER:[/color] Bring the wagons to my station. I'll unlock them and my inserters will unload the cargo right away. Then just pick up the goods. The bad news is you can't use the wagons for your purposes. \n
msg-base-25=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] I still don't like it, but the smuggler kept his promise.\n
msg-base-26=[color=brown]SMUGGLER:[/color] Yes, if you have any troubles again, feel free to come back. My price is simple. Keep away the bugs from my abode.\n
msg-base-27=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Now back to business. We need to secure another mine, but this one's gonna be a little tricky. It's on an island [font=default-bold]NORTHWEST[/font] of here. The only access is through the railway bridge. Problem is, the pirates have fortified the island. \n
msg-base-28=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] But fortune favors us. Their power grid is routed through [font=default-bold]BIG ELECTRIC POLES[/font]. If we destroy them, we'll definitely [font=default-bold]DISABLE THE LASER TOWERS[/font] on the island. The thing is, we can also use their grid to [font=default-bold]POWER THE MINE[/font]. You have to decide what's the best approach for you. \n
msg-base-29=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Wow, you did it. I have to admit, you're really cool.\n
msg-base-30=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] The Riverside refineries have long-term suffered from a shortage of crude oil. Our next job is to take over the [font=default-bold]PUMPJACKS[/font] in the [font=default-bold]LAKESHORE[/font] area. \n\nBut be warned. There are bugs swarming near the pumps.\n
msg-base-31=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] One more thing. I heard a rumor that there's an abandoned iron mine in the [font=default-bold]PURPLE FOREST[/font]. I don't know exactly where, but maybe the name has something to it.
msg-base-32=[color=blue]SANCTUARY BASE:[/color] Hello? Can anybody hear us? We're under attack! \n\nThe bugs! They're coming. There are too many of them! We don't know how long we can hold on!\n
msg-base-33=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] We hear you Sanctuary...\n\nEngineer, I've closed the railway drawbridge near Lakeshore and sent you some equipment.  When you' re ready, head to the [font=default-bold]SANCTUARY BASE[/font] and clear the area of biter nests.\n
msg-base-34=[color=blue]SANCTUARY BASE:[/color] Oh, thank you. You saved us. \n\nBut our sanctuary has taken a lot of damage. Our steam generator is out of power. The bugs must have damaged the water pipes. \n
msg-base-35=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] It would also be a good idea to fix the railway so we can supply Sanctuary from Riverside.\n
msg-base-36=[color=blue]SANCTUARY BASE:[/color] We have power again. Well done. I don't know how to thank you for everything. \n\nI heard that you're reestablishing the railway connection to Hell' s Gate. Maybe I can help you after all. \n\nThere's a [font=default-bold]NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SOUTH[/font] from the Sanctuary near [font=default-bold]LAKESHORE[/font]. Unfortunately, the technicians were forced to abandon it. They say some [font=default-bold]BEHEMOTH WORMS[/font] are crawling out of the ground and ravaging the area. \n
msg-base-37=[color=blue]SANCTUARY BASE:[/color] If you [font=default-bold]KILL THE WORMS[/font], you can restore the power plant. \n\nAnd there' s a uranium mine near the plant that I' m sure you can use. \n
msg-base-38=[color=blue]SANCTUARY BASE:[/color] I also recommend visiting the iron mine [font=default-bold]TUNDRA[/font]. We lost contact with the miners before the attack. The mine is the [font=default-bold]WEST[/font] from here. \n\nThen there's the stone mine to the [font=default-bold]EAST[/font] that' s still under construction. Honestly, our bosses often forgot about that mine and that's why it was never been finished. Ironically, the mine is called the [font=default-bold]FORGOTTEN[/font]. I believe there's still material lying around for construction.\n
msg-base-39=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Thank you for the information Sanctuary. Those are valuable tips that will help us a lot.\n
msg-base-40=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] The power plant is under our control. Now we just have to get it repaired and operational. We can use the uranium not only for reactor fuel, but also for munitions. \n
msg-base-41=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] I have just received information that pirates are plundering three mines in the [font=default-bold]NORTH[/font]. \n\n[font=default-bold]GRASSLAND, BRIDGE MINE[/font] and [font=default-bold]BORDER FACILITY[/font] are regularly visited by enemy trains. Our objective is to retake the mines and stop the trains. \n\nI expect heavy resistance. \n
msg-base-42=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] The iron mine [font=default-bold]GRASSLAND[/font] is the closest. Apparently, pirates have installed gun turrets there and may have mined the area.\n
msg-base-43=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] The coal mine near the big [font=default-bold]BRIDGE[/font] is going to be a bit of nut. The access road over the bridge is heavily defended and it looks like the pirates have barricades in some parts of the track.\n
msg-base-44=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] [font=default-bold]BORDER FACILITY[/font] mines copper but is currently partially decommissioned. The pirates failed to hang the mine's security systems. If we bring the power, we'll probably activate the drones, which will immediately begin initiating defenses against the pirates.\n
msg-base-44.1=[color=brown]SMUGGLER:[/color] If you hijack the train, don't forget to stop by in my station. I will gladly help you again.
msg-base-45=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] I always love to see that pirate vermin flee from justice.\n
msg-base-46=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Ah. I was about to rejoice, but those pirate suckers won't let up. \n\nThe [font=default-bold]PINEHILL[/font] outpost is in trouble. The pirates have taken and fortified the entire mountain. There's coal and oil deposits. \n\nDamn! It's so shitty. The terrain is very difficult and there are bugs everywhere.
msg-base-47=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] To the [font=default-bold]WEST[/font] from Pinehill is the [font=default-bold]WILDENESS[/font] mine. As if our task to conquer the mountain wasn't difficult enough. Engineer, we don't have to restore this mine if you don't want to.\n
msg-base-48=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Well done, engineer. We've secured the Pinehill outpost. \n\nWait, I'm picking up an incoming transmission.\n
msg-base-49=[color=cyan]CROSSROAD R.S. HQ BASE:[/color] This is [font=default-bold]Crossroad Railway System HQ[/font] ...(interference)... the pirates are launching an attack on our base. Our ammunition depot has been sabotaged and we have lost all ...(interference)... to our artillery ...( interference )... \n\nDreadnought EGSS Astrid is still several light years away from the planet and ...(interference)... We need to get the ammunition to the [font=default-bold]DOCKS[/font]. ...(interference)... \n\nA captured pirate base wants to use artillery against us. We need ...(interference)...  assistance available ...(interference)...\n\n ...(loss of signal)...\n
msg-base-50=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] \nHoly shit!\n
msg-base-51=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Wait, like really? A Dreadnought! Corpos must be seriously desperate. \n\nThis is bad. Really, really bad. \n\nHold on, I get a lock on the HQ position so we can see how they're standing...\n
msg-base-52=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] I think the bridge is locked for security reasons. Looks like they're having blackouts at the harbour. HQ mentioned the [font=default-bold]DOCKS[/font]. Maybe we can find the ammo they need there. If we can get the roboport up and running, the drones can transport the ammunition.\n\nWe need to contact the Stillwater facility. They could help us power up the roboport.\n
msg-base-53=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Oh, no. \n\nStillwater facility. They... They're gone. \n\nI see, I see only ruins.\n
msg-base-54=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] \nI had a friend there... \n\nDamn pirates. They're gonna pay for this!\n
msg-base-55=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Engineer. I have one last request for you. I'd like if you kick some pirate asses! \n\nYou might find something useful in the ruins of [font=default-bold]STILLWATER.[/font] I know there was a uranium mine nearby. \n\nWe need to use all the resources we have. There's an iron and copper mine [font=default-bold]SAND OASIS[/font] in the desert somewhere [font=default-bold]EAST[/font] from Stillwater.\n
msg-base-56=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] And one more thing. \n\nThose pirate assholes are experimenting something on the bug nests in their little fortress near Pinehill.  \n\nNuke 'em.\n
msg-base-56.1=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] F*ck. No artillery ammo in the crates.
msg-base-57=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Okay. This is it. Our last task. \n\nThe pirates have been pissing on us for too long. Now it's time for us to pillage them this time and take everything what's ours!\n
msg-base-58=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] [font=default-bold]RAID PIRATE MAIN BASE[/font] and [font=default-bold]STEAL THEIR ARTILLERY AMMUNITION[/font]. I know it's a little crazy, but we have enough resources now to win this fight!\n
msg-base-59=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] Ahhh. This is a really satisfying view. Pirate base burns! \n\nNow, [font=default-bold]TRANSPORT THE AMMUNITION TO THE PROVIDER CHEST[/font] near the roboport at the [font=default-bold]DOCKS[/font]. \n\nYou did well, Engineer, you did really well.
msg-base-60=[color=orange]CROSSROAD R.S. MERCENARY:[/color] It's done. Now watch.\n
msg-base-61=[color=cyan]CROSSROAD R.S. HQ BASE:[/color] Ha ha! I don't know how you did it, but you are really crazy bastards. \n\nMy cannons will be ready any minute. Well done!\n
msg-base-62=[color=green]INCOMING TRANSMISSION:[/color] \n\nThis is captain of the EGSS Astrid . What is your status?\n\n

think-msg1=Oh shit, that train is fast! 
think-msg2=Finally, that was a ride! I hope I didn't fry the car's engine... 
think-msg3=Now I need to hook the locomotive to the wagons and direct the train to the Riverside base.
think-msg4=I agree. This is really crazy.
