msg-base-1=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Welcome to the [font=default-bold]HELL'S GATE[/font] space port. We've been notified of your problematic journey to the facility. Our company apologizes for the damage caused to your ship, and all will be compensated under our contract. \n\nWe will now begin the briefing.
msg-base-2=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Your mission will be to build new bases in the northern regions of the planet and [font=default-bold]PROVIDE A SUPPLY OF RESOURCES[/font] for export to Earth. You have the necessary equipment ready in your vehicle. 
msg-base-3=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] The risk is represented by the over-evolved insects in the area. They react aggressively to any attempts at deep drilling and are practically intolerant of any form of air pollution. \n\nDirect confrontation had no effect. Therefore, we trust that [font=default-bold]YOU[/font] can find a way to resolve this situation. \n\nIf you succeed, you will be paid according to the terms of your contract.
msg-base-4=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Proceed to the northern fortifications. Please note that you are not allowed to enter the other sections of the space port. Do not attempt to interfere with the facility in any way!
msg-base-5=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] We just received a message that the [font=default-bold]ELECTRIC LINE[/font] near the northern fortifications has been compromised. It is not significant damage, but the supply belts for ammunition to the gun turrets are currently not working. Because of this, the [font=default-bold]MAIN GATE[/font] is on lockdown for safety reasons. Would you be so kind and fix this problem before your journey? 
msg-base-6=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Before you go, I want to wish you good luck. We believe that with your knowledge of this planet you will succeed far better than we have. 
msg-base-7=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] We have detected an increasing number of active enemies in your area.
msg-base-8=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Your accomplishments are impressive. \n\nAs a part of our contract, we're demanding an expansion of oil production. Can you handle it? \n\nWe need at least 10 pumpjacks to be active.
msg-base-8.1=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Crude oil is not suitable for interstellar transport. Process it into solid fuel.
msg-base-9=[color=orange]SPACE PORT:[/color] Thank you for fulfilling all the requirements. \n\nWe consider all mission objectives have been completed. Would you like to extend your contract?
think-repair= The pole must power the inserter, otherwise the main gate will not open.
think-secure-base= The mining drills are done. It's time to secure the perimeter.
think-secure2-base= I should build more advanced weapons for defence, maybe laser.
think-oil= There's a lot of oil in the place. Last time, it proved useful not only for defence, but also for fuel and explosives.
think-biter1= That's to be expected, hopefully the defense will hold up.
think-more-oil= I will have to find the other areas rich in oil.
think-biter2= It won't be easy to control multiple areas, fortunately the local terrain is well suited for building defences.
